Download and extract buildroot.
[fill this in]

cd into buildroot.

run:
make menuconfig

Follow the instructions in
menuconfig_options.txt

Now run make, or run make with fancy-like build logging:
time make 2>&1 | tee build.log
    tee will copy standard input to a file and to standard output.
    Inspect this with less.

To download all the necessary sources for the current configuration, run:
make source


Now we need to get this onto an SD card.
Format an SD card with two partitions.
    200 MB fat32 partition, labeled boot.
    larger ext4 partition (Angstrom is ext3), labeled rootfs.
Should we set any flags on the partitions? My (successful) Angstrom build has:
    boot:
        fat32
        boot
        lba
    rootfs:
        no flags.
Looks like we need the flags.

cd buildroot/output/images
cp MLO u-boot.img zImage am335x-boneblack.dtb /media/kmatthews/boot/

Separate from buildroot, create a uEnv.txt file to tell u-boot how to boot:
Create uEnv.txt and add:
bootdir=
bootpart=0:1
uenvcmd=run loadimage;run loadramdisk;run findfdt;run loadfdt;run mmcloados

cd <correct_folder>
cp uEnv.txt /media/kmatthews/boot/

Now extract the rootfs (as root so the permissions are correct) into the rootfs partition:
sudo tar -C /media/kmatthews/rootfs/ -xf rootfs.tar

Eject the SD card.

Connect the console cable:
    Ground - J1
    Receive - J4 (White on my dongle)
    Transmit - (Green on my dongle)
    +3v     - P9:3 or P9:4

While the board is booting, push down the button by the SD card (S2).
