buildroot toolchain creates a cross-compiler for you.
    downloads binutils, c library, gcc, etc.

external toolchain assumes that a toolchain is prexisting, either created by you or someone else.
    This is faster.

To examine the build log for major events,
grep ">>>" build.log | less

If you encounter
    fakeroot: preload library `libfakeroot.so' not found, aborting.
You may need to run a make clean or edit:
    output/host/usr/bin/fakeroot
fakeroot is a script, and your path is hard-coded in there. Did you move your directory? If so, it buildroot will not notice.
I fixed this one problem but then there were others... just did a 'make clean; make' instead.
