~~~ Build a bare BeagleBoneBlack distro using the built-in defconfig ~~~
Download a fresh copy of buildroot

make beaglebone_defconfig

# No changes in menuconfig, so don't bother.
make menuconfig

make

Flash it with:
sudo dd if=<dir>/sdcard.img of=/dev/sdX

Boot off the SD card. It boots!

The root login is root, no password.



~~~ Adding a package with no libraries ~~~
Edit:
    <buildroot>/package/Config.in
Add a new menu item here.

Create a new directory in package for your product.
Beware '_' in folder names?
Create a Config.in file here.
Create a <product>.mk file here.

Select the item in menuconfig.
make.

As before, dd if=<> of=<>

If you want to save this defconfig, you can't simply use make defconfig -- this will overwrite the beaglebone defconfig.
You should use:
make savedefconfig BR2_DEFCONFIG=<path>/<filename>_defconfig
